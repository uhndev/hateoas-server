/**
* WorkflowState
*
* @class WorkflowState
* @description The State model is used to represent a state in the
*              application workflow. Each State contains links to
*              other states. These links are divided into three
*              types: ['queries', 'links', 'template']
*              Queries represents a list of links to query the
*              object. These queries should be queries to objects
*              related to the current application state. Default
*              blueprint queries should not be re-created.
*              Links represents a list of links to related objects.
*              These objects should be associated to the current
*              object viewed in the current application state.
*              Template represents an object that shows how the
*              current object is created.
