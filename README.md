dados-server
============
DADOS is a single software platform for electronically collecting and managing data related to treatment outcomes. The application has been implemented within various clinics and departments at UHN to handle prospective clinical trials and subspecialty registries. Initially created by integrating and enhancing two open-source Web-based applications developed by Duke University, DADOS-Prospective and DADOS-Survey, the DADOS platform is currently developed, maintained, and supported by the Techna Institute for use within UHN and other research institutions across the world. New features to improve usability and expand its applicability in the field of translational and clinical research are continually developed and enhanced.

## Installing Node without Administrative Rights

There are 2 parts of the NODEJS Windows installer.

1. Download the **node.exe** binary into a local folder.
  a. [32-bit](http://nodejs.org/dist/latest)
  b. [64-bit](http://nodejs.org/dist/latest/x64)
2. Add your local folder to your PATH Environment.
3. Download the [NPM **zip**](http://nodejs.org/dist/npm/).
4. Extract the **.zip** to a local folder.
5. Add the local folder into the PATH Environment.

## Installing Prerequisites
```
$ sudo apt-get install nodejs
$ sudo apt-get install npm
$ sudo apt-get install mongodb
$ sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib

$ sudo npm install -g sails
$ sudo npm install -g bower
$ sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
$ sudo npm install -g phantomjs
```

## Install Dependencies
```
$ npm install
```

## Running The Application
```
$ sails lift
```
Your application should run on the 1337 port so in your browser just go to [http://localhost:1337](http://localhost:1337)

## Testing
Run ```grunt test``` to test (uses the test environment & database)
If you'd like to generate fake test data in the app, follow these steps:
1. Make sure you have python installed and python-setuptools
2. Use easy_install to install modules: `easy_install requests fake-factory`
3. Configure amount of data to be generated by modifying the `config/scripts/dados-pygen/settings.json`
4. Run dados-pygen in config/scripts/dados-pygen: `python config/scripts/dados-pygen/generate-data.py`

## Documentation
Run ```grunt generate-docs``` to auto-generate sails documentation for backend code.

## Troubleshooting

#### grunt errors
Depending on your setup, when you run sails you may encounter any of these errors:
```
Waiting ... Fatal error: watch ENOSPC
Error: Maximum call stack size exceeded
```
To resolve this, make sure that your version of grunt-contrib-watch is at least 0.6.0 in your package.json
and if all else fails, increase the number of files that can be watched via the command:
```
$ echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p
```

#### bcrypt errors
If you are having trouble installing bcrypt, make sure you have installed the node-gyp package and its dependencies globally:
```
$ sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential
$ sudo npm install -g node-gyp
```

##### Windows Users
1. install Python http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.5/
2. Install Visual Studio 2012/13 Express (or other)
3. Install Windows SDK (for Windows 7 / 8)
4. Install Win64 OpenSSL v1.0.1g
5. Then run `npm install bcrypt`

#### npm errors
If during the prerequisite installation phase you find that npm keeps failing to install packages, cleaning the npm cache may be of use:
```
$ npm cache clean
```
However if all else fails, a fresh start may be required **(NOTE the following will completely uninstall node and all global npm packages)**
```
sudo apt-get remove nodejs
sudo apt-get remove npm
sudo apt-get autoremove
rm -Rf ~/.npm
rm -Rf /usr/local/lib/node_modules
rm -Rf /usr/local/lib/node
rm -Rf /usr/local/lib/npm
rm -Rf $HOME/tmp
```
